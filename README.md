# genshin-simulator

While farming for artifacts a lot of us might have came across crossroads where we would have to decide between giving a hp% artifact or a healing bonus artifact to our dedicated healer. We usually have to invest our hard earned resources into the artifacts and check which one's better. 
This project aims to predict the final stats of your favourite genshin character after giving or removing certain equipments and increasing or decreasing the level.
The aim is to choose a character then select the level, equip it with a weapon and give it artifacts with main and sub-stats of our choice so we know which artifacts are better. 
The front end is supposed to be made in HTML, CSS and Js. As for the backend we are planning to use SQL tables for ascension stats of the characters.
